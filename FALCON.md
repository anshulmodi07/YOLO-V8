## Application Use Case: "ISS Guardian"

### 1. The Real-World Problem

On the International Space Station (ISS), the safety of the crew and the integrity of the station are paramount. Manually tracking the location and status of critical equipmentâ€”such as fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and essential toolboxesâ€”is a time-consuming task prone to human error.

- A misplaced tool can become a dangerous projectile in zero gravity.
- An untracked, depleted fire extinguisher is a major safety hazard.

### 2. Our Solution: The "ISS Guardian" Application

**ISS Guardian** is a web-based tool designed for rapid, automated safety and inventory checks. An astronaut can take a photo of a module or storage area with a tablet and upload it to the app.

Our optimized **YOLOv8** object detection model instantly analyzes the image, identifies critical equipment, and provides visual confirmation with bounding boxes.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Instant Safety Audits:** Quickly verify that all fire extinguishers are in their designated locations.
- **Efficient Inventory Management:** Get an immediate count of oxygen tanks or toolboxes before mission-critical tasks.
- **Reduced Crew Workload:** Automate tedious tasks, allowing astronauts to focus on research and operations.

## Maintaining the Model with Falcon

A model is only as good as its data. As the ISS evolves, our model must evolve too. The **Falcon digital twin** platform provides a cost-effective and efficient way to simulate new conditions and update the model accordinglyâ€”eliminating the need for real-world space data collection.

### ðŸ”§ Scenario 1: An Objectâ€™s Appearance Changes

**Problem:** A new model of fire extinguisher, with a different shape and color, is introduced. The current model may fail to recognize it.

**Falcon Solution:**

1. **Update Digital Twin:** Modify the 3D asset for the "FireExtinguisher" class in Falcon to reflect the new design.
2. **Generate Synthetic Data:** Use Falcon to produce thousands of images with the updated extinguisher under varied lighting, angles, and occlusions.
3. **Fine-Tune Model:** Retrain YOLOv8 with this new dataset so it recognizes both old and new extinguisher types.

### ðŸš« Scenario 2: A New Object Causes Confusion

**Problem:** A similarly shaped medical supply kit is introduced, leading to false positivesâ€”it's misidentified as a "ToolBox."

**Falcon Solution:**

1. **Update Digital Twin:** Add the 3D model of the new medical kit to the Falcon simulation.
2. **Generate "Hard Negative" Data:** Create a synthetic dataset where the medical kit appears near toolboxes but is explicitly not labeled as one.
3. **Fine-Tune Model:** Train the model on this targeted dataset to improve classification accuracy and reduce false positives.

## Conclusion

By integrating **Falcon** into our long-term model maintenance strategy, the **"ISS Guardian"** application remains a reliable, adaptive, and critical safety tool for the ISS crew. It ensures continued accuracy, flexibility, and operational excellence as the stationâ€™s environment evolves.
